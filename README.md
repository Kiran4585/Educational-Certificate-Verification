🎓 Educational Certificate Verification using Blockchain
A secure and decentralized application built to verify educational certificates using blockchain technology. This project aims to eliminate certificate forgery and enable instant verification by storing academic credentials on a tamper-proof distributed ledger.

🚀 Project Overview
The traditional method of verifying educational certificates is manual, time-consuming, and prone to fraud. This project leverages the power of blockchain to ensure:

Authenticity of certificates

Integrity of data

Transparency in the verification process

🛠️ Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Blockchain: Ethereum (using Ganache and Solidity smart contracts)

Tools: Truffle, Metamask, Ganache, Web3.js

📌 Features
🎓 Upload and register certificates on the blockchain

🔍 Verify certificate authenticity via certificate ID

🔐 Immutable record storage to prevent tampering

👤 Role-based access (admin/institute and verifier)

🧪 How It Works
Institution Login: Upload student details and issue certificates via smart contract.

Blockchain Storage: Certificate details are hashed and stored on Ethereum blockchain.

Verifier Access: Any third party can verify a certificate by entering its unique ID.

🔧 Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
